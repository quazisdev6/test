DCA group delivers high quality high level design documents and component design documents to fully describe the end-to-end solution. The solutions include integration requirements as well as application components mapped to infrastructure. We ensure that the business requirements are satisfied by the solution design using requirements traceability techniques. Our Solution Architects are involved through design, development, testing and implementation.



We adapt to the clients in-house methodology or use our own lightweight hybrid of agile and waterfall to design high quality solutions. We leverage our clientâ€™s technical infrastructure and ensure that scalability and availability non-functional requirements are taken into consideration from the outset. We have delivered projects on platforms ranging from Mainframes to open source web apps.
