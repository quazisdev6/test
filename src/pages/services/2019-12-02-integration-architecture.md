DCA group’s Integration Architecture practice spans Architecture Roadmap definition, setup of Integration Centre of Excellence (CoE) and Integration solution design and build.



Our clients benefit from proven Integration Principles and Patterns refined over 20 years of real customer projects. This approach standardizes the terminology and guide designers and developers to make better decisions.



We have helped establish multiple Integration CoEs – including definition of methodology, roles and responsibilities and staffing. Our integration implementations use proven high level patterns and best practice designs for Event Driven and Service Oriented Architectures.



Our team has design expertise in Oracle Service Bus (OSB), WebSphere Message Broker (WMB, IIB), MQ and JMS and open source integration tools (Mule, Tomcat).
