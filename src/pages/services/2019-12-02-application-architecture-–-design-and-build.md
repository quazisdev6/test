Our approach to Application Architecture combines the best of layered designs, OO and modern Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). We use well defined DCA artifact templates and diagrams as well as modeling tools for design (Sparx Enterprise Architect and XML Spy). Our experience covers all types of applications — Web, back-end SOA, customer facing IVR, client-server and Mainframe.



Our Business and Data Architects and BAs work closely with business partners to elicit and document the data and functional requirements. The data requirements are expressed as logical and physical data models. We use a variety of techniques to model functional requirements – including use cases.



We are experienced with the leading application environment and can adapt the design to your selected platform. Our projects have leveraged WebLogic, WebSphere, Tomcat application servers and the most common DBMS – Oracle, DB2, Sybase, MySQL and Teradata.



We leverage the most common Java frameworks e.g. Spring MVC, Transaction Management and Batch to implement state of the art SOA applications. Automated Unit testing and load-testing, with tools like JUnit and JMeter ensure high quality components.
